Description:

LFI stands for Local File Includes - it’s a file local inclusion vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files that exist on the target web server. Typically this is exploited by abusing dynamic file inclusion mechanisms that don’t sanitize user input.

Scripts that take filenames as parameters without sanitizing the user input are good candidates for LFI vulnerabilities, a good example would be the following PHP script foo.php?file=image.jpg which takes image.jpg as a parameter. An attacker would simply replace image.jpg and insert a payload. Normally a directory traversal payload is used that escapes the script directory and traverses the filesystem directory structure, exposing sensitive files such as foo.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd or sensitive files within the web application itself. Exposing sensitive information or configuration files containing SQL usernames and passwords.

Note: In some cases, depending on the nature of the LFI vulnerability it’s possible to run system executables.
