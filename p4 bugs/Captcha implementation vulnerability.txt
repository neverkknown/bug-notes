CAPTCHA (“Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”) is a type of challenge-response test used by many web applications to ensure that the response is not generated by a computer. CAPTCHA implementations are often vulnerable to various kinds of attacks even if the generated CAPTCHA is unbreakable. This section will help you to identify these kinds of attacks.


Steps:

1- I have checked rate limit on https://abc.com
2- i have received multiple mails.
