Hi Team,

The removal of account is one of the sensitive part of a web application that needs to protect, therefore removing an account should validate the authenticity of the user, however i have found that when removing an account, the system did not require the user to input the account password.

Steps to reproduce:

    go to https://abc.com and login to your account.
    go to profile/settings.
    you'll see the "close account" button.
    press that button and you'll be successfully deleted your account.

Mitigation:
Put reauthentication when anyone/user is deleting an account, ask the user to input password before the completion of the account deletion.
