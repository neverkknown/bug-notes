Summary:
Information exposure through /debug in ms5.twitter.com

Description:
Debug page from ms5.twitter.com exposes internal info, such as internal IPs and headers.
Steps To Reproduce:

    Visit ms5.twitter.com/debug
    See internal IP and header-names used
    To gather more internal IPs, just refresh (or script curl requests) and you'll get a new internal IP every time.

Impact:

If an attacker gains access to your network, knowledge of internal IPs could help them know where to target.
Supporting Material/References:

I made a script to make requests to see if internal IPs changed and every time I got a new one. Here is the 20 IPs I found using this technique:

    10.49.205.118
    10.45.237.113
    10.81.156.108
    10.58.127.114
    10.58.103.105
    10.58.217.103
    10.42.70.113
    10.45.222.103
    10.58.101.114
    10.45.221.103
    10.45.109.100
    10.42.70.119
    10.43.71.127
    10.48.219.111
    10.44.90.100
    10.46.246.111
    10.43.73.138
    10.46.6.102
    10.45.65.104
    10.45.64.108

Impact

Debug pages should not be public. Giving away internal IPs means that an attacker could use this info for their advantage and know which IPs to target.
