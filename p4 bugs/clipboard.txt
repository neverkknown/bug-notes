Steps:
Install an application
Start the application.
Enter text into input fields that ask for sensitive data. 
Try copying this data into a note application. 
If strings can be copied and pasted, the clipboard is enabled.

IMPACT

In enabled clipboard increases the risk of the exposure of sensitive information. 
If data such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other sensitive information is cut and paste from or into the application, it may be saved to the phone and accessed at a later date.
