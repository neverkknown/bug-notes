Hello Team,

I have found a vulnerability issue in context to sensitive token on HTTP

Description - There is an issue with the weak password implementation where the reset token is being sent on HTTP and an attacker can grab the token through Wireshark 

Steps:

Go to forgot password page of the website
Enter the registered email 
Click on submit
Go to the email inbox for the reset link
Right-click on the box and copy the link    
Paste the link on a new tab or a notepad

Impact - The sensitive token can be grabbed by an attacker through Wireshark and the attacker can reset the password of the original user which can lead to an account takeover.
