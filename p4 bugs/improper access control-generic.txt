Vulnerability Name - Improper Access Control - Generic

Hi team,

I found one issue related to your 2FA system on https://www.kraken.com/u/security

POC

1 access the same account on https://www.kraken.com in two devices
2 on device 'A' go to https://www.kraken.com/u/security> complete all steps to change the 2FA system

Now the 2FA is activated from Phone number

3 back to device 'B' reload the page

The session still active and also i have updated new email.
Impact

In this scenario when 2FA is changing the other sessions of the account are not invalidated.

2FA is required to login. I believe the expected and recommended behavior here is to terminate the other sessions> request a new login> request the 2FA code> so then give the account access again
