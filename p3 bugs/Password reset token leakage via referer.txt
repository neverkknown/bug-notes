Description: 
It has been identified that the application is leaking referrer token to third party sites. In this case it was found that the password reset token is being leaked to third party sites which is a issue knowing the fact that it can allow any malicious users to use the token and reset the passwords of the victim.

Steps:
1. Sent a password reset request using forget password
2. Check your email 
3. Copy your reset page link and paste in another tab.
4. Click on any social media link(on follow us section)
5. Intercept the request(I have used burp suite)
6. You can see the link for reset password in referer

Impact
It allows the person who has control of particular site to change the user's password (CSRF attack), because this person knows reset password token of the user.
