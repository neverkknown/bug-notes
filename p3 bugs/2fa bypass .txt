Hi, While I was testing your web application https://app-stage.bill.com/ I found a vulnerability in MFA implementation.
When Verifying mobile number for mfa it allowing user to verify any random number for verification just by taking request in burp & change the response from false to True.

Steps to Reproduce:

1-go to https://abc.com and enter any mobile number.

2-Now enter any six digit number in OTP box & click enter
3-Take this request in repeater & do intercept the response
4- In response of that request just change the false to true
5- Mobile number is successfully verified without even real OTP.
